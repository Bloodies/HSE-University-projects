Writer/director/producer/actorHaroldP.Warrenwasafertilizersalesmanbeforethisfilm---'nuffsaid! (1/10)
||As I indicated in the summary, Warren was a fertilizer salesman and frankly, his taking on the helm of this film isn't much of a stretch (insert your own scatological joke here).
||The film is a low-budget mess--so cheap and so badly put together that it is not at all hyperbole to say that Ed Wood never made a film quite this bad! Sure, Wood's films were horrible, but at least they had better production values than a 32 second limit to scenes due to the cheap equipment or the use of only three people to dub all the voices in the film! Heck, compared to this mess, PLAN 9 is a Merchant-Ivory production!! The film begins with a guy getting lost with his family and refusing to ask for directions (insert own dumb husband joke here).
||Naturally, he arrives at a home whose caretaker is "special".
||This freaky guy talks about "the Master won't like you staying here" and crap like that and so what do these idiots do?! Yep, they get out and practically force themselves on this deformed halfwit.
||And, almost as soon as they get out of the car, the wife begins whining.
||You can tell she knew she was in a horror film because everything that happened sounded like it was the apocalypse.
||I half expected her to say something like "They have blue curtains....YAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" or "Honey,....I think the couch is going to eat us....YAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!".
||I know that most of this was the problem of the dubbing, but it also looked like the lady was told to scream and act scared about everything!! Well, the film only gets worse from this terrible start.
||When bad things finally do come, the screaming and silliness goes into overdrive.
||But, as another reviewer said, so many horrible things have been said about this dreadful film that it's hardly worth heaping on the criticism.
||The bottom line is that I cannot think of a single film that was directed, edited, acted or filmed as badly as this one....oh, and the script was written by a Fox Terrier.
||Bad, but perhaps a great film to watch and laugh at with friends.

||If it wasn't for MST3K, I wouldn't have seen Manos: The Hands of Fate.
||I knew I had to see it to see if it really was that bad.
||The negative criticisms and those slamming it as the worst movie ever do not lie, Manos: The Hands of Fate is as bad as all that.
||There is such thing as a terrible movie that has novelty comic value, but there is also such thing as a movie that is too inept to take that into consideration.
||Some will disagree, but I consider Manos: The Hands of Fate as a good example of the latter.
||To call the way the movie is made amateurish is being too kind, the camera work and editing are all over the place and makes anything that happens incomprehensible.
||The visual effects are dated and make everything even more artificial than it already is, while the bizarre and often out of sync sound effects and a score that is shrill and monotonous are enough to make your ears bleed.
||And even when your poor ears are suffering enough, they are assaulted even more by dialogue that is stilted, insultingly cheesy and too talky and some of the worst and annoying acting ever in film history.
||The villain is quite possibly the most laughable and underwhelming villain ever and you'd be hard pressed to find one that is worse-acted than here.
||Torga is the best thing about Manos: The Hands of Fate, but that's saying nothing as he's still irritating.
||The direction is so flat that you have to look hard to find evidence of any direction at all, while the story is incredibly thin and is so plodding that you're dying of boredom.
||In conclusion, hopelessly inept.

Manos:TheHandsofFate (not rated/10)
||Manos: The Hands of Fate (1966)BOMB (out of 4) A husband takes his wife and young daughter on vacation but they end up on a strange road that ends at a strange house.
||Inside is a deformed man named Torgo (John Reynolds) who says the family can stay but soon they begin to regret that and especially once Master (Tom Neyman) shows up and wants to add another wife to his collection.For three decades Edward D.
||Wood's PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE was the "bad" movie that everyone wanted to hail and worship as some sort of champion of bad movies.
||Then, about five or so years ago, this one here started to gain momentum from fans who wanted to crown it the king of awful movies.
||The movie even got a huge online campaign to have the print remastered so now fans of this disaster can enjoy it in a great looking version or at least compared to what has previously been out there.Is MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE the worst movie ever made? I guess it depends on how you look at it.
||I personally look at a movie like this as something that was made by non-professional people with little to no talent and little to no knowledge of what they were doing.
||We know the technical issues like the camera used and how the audio was destroyed, which forced them into some horrendous dubbing.
||So, with all of that said, it is the worst? I personally think talented filmmakers with large budgets who turn out poor films should be looked down upon much more than what is here.With that said, there's no question this is one of the worst ever made but it remains slightly entertaining thanks to how bad it is.
||The music score is without question the worst thing about the picture as it's never fitting to what is actually on the screen and this is especially true early on when we first meet Torgo.
||I mean, Torgo is meant to be menacing or scary so why on Earth put circus music behind him? The performances are all rather poor and the dubbing here is among the worst you're ever going to hear and especially the young child who sounds like an eighty-year-old woman.
||Poor editing.
||Poor cinematography.
||Poor humor.
||You get the idea.
||The most shocking thing about how bad this movie is is that there's never even an attempt to make what you're watching scary.MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE deserves its reputation as one of the worst films ever made but who can resist the charm of the film, its backstory or The Master?

Justdull (2/10)
||MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE is one of those Z-grade indie B-movies that regularly gets voted as the "worst ever" horror film, and watching it it's easy to see why.
||This is a nonsensical, amateurish production in which a family's road trip is despoiled when they stumble upon a Satanic cult with murder in mind.
||The plot isn't too bad, actually; it figures as a sort-of precursor to the '70s black magic vibe as evinced by RACE WITH THE DEVIL and THE DEVIL'S RAIN.
||Sadly, it's the execution which lets this film down.
||There are performances so wooden as to be unbelievable, very bad acting indeed, and camerawork where the central figures aren't even in focus.
||Not to mention random padding, sluggish pacing, and the like.
||It's not even so bad it's good most of the time; it's just dull.

||They take a wrong turn onto a dirt road and get lost in a maze of dead end paths.
||They find an isolated home and its caretaker Torgo.

||Torgo keeps mentioning The Master.
||Peppy disappears and Debbie finds The Master's dog.
||The Master and his bickering wives awaken.This is horrible filmmaking.
||Filmmaker Harold P.
||Warren is also the star playing Michael.
||He's not an actual filmmaker but rather a fertilizer salesman.
||Supposedly, he made this on a bet.
||Warren is impossibly incompetent in his filmmaking.
||The list is too long.
||The acting is bad but it's made infinitely worst with terrible voice dubbing.
||It's something one has to see to believe.
||All of it is horrible.
||The worst and possibly the best is John Reynolds who plays Torgo.
||Again seeing is believing although he is also rumored to be constantly on acid.
||The whole thing is a mess but some of it is so unbelievably bad that it's actually funny.
||The catfighting wives is so stupid that I cannot stop shaking my head in disbelief and I hope they kept that handy cape.
||After its disastrous release, it quickly fell into anonymity until Mystery Science Theater 3000 did a show on it.
||This is one for the record books.

||This isn't even fun.
||There is no plot.
||Three dumb people end up at a house in the country.
||There is all this whining about being tired and not going another step.
||Imagine one look at that guy and the strange surrounding would send anyone fleeing.
||Not these people.
||They go in anyway.
||Before they are bored to death, things start happening.
||What things.
||I don't care.
||They have all the time in the world to get back in the car and go.
||Good grief, they could have slept in the car.
||Then there are those two kids, necking in the other car.
||It must be a marathon session.
||They have been parking for about four days.
||Oh well.
||We get to meet the master who runs around in funny pajamas and apparently has a way with the ladies who do weird things, crawling all over each other.
||Of course, by the time they do decided to leave, the father can't get the car started.
||The wife wails and that insipid little girl just kind of stands around.
||The ending is so dumb, you have to see it.

Youknowthefilmisbadwhentheonlymemorablethingisthevillain'srobe. (1/10)
||Looking like a cross between Hitler, David Merrick and one of the Village People, Tom Neyman (as "The Master") appears as if he's reading lines off a teleprompter, not even giving any effort to give any sort of performance.
||This wretched Satanic themed horror film deals with father, mother and little girl who are on vacation and turn off on the wrong road.
||John Reynolds is an Igor like creature who allows them to stay the night at his master's residence, indicating that Neyman is some sort of undead creature.
||He's also got an abundance of wives who fight at the drop of a wisecrack, and horribly annoying eerie music takes over when the writer runs out of idiotic things for the characters to say.
||I just wish I knew where I could get a giant over-sized robe with two huge hands over the front of it.
||At first while watching this, I immediately thought of that scene in the Tim Burton movie "Ed Wood" where a Paramount employee is viewing "Glen or Glenda" and begins to think it's some sort of practical joke.
||But like that poor sap locked in front of a movie screen for just over an hour, it began to occur to me that whoever wrote this tripe and whoever casted it, directed it, edited it (which it needed more of) and scored it truly needed psychiatric help.
||There are hints of several characters being tortured, but unless somebody can be slapped to death, I don't think it would really work.
||The one scene that is remotely scary is when Reynolds finally gets his come-uppance, but for the most part, this is just a lot of talk about who is going to die, who will be tortured, who will be freed, and who will win the Razzy for worst acting of the year.
||Spare yourself the torture and avoid, or as Frank-N-Furter's castle in "Rocky Horror" warns, "Enter at your own risk!"

"Well,wheredidthisplacecomefrom?Itwasn'therebefore." (2/10)
||You think I can say something about this movie that seven hundred plus other reviewers haven't said already? At one point in the picture, the Torgo guy (John Reynolds) states to the couple with the kid - "There is no way out of here".
||And right there, that about sums up how you'll feel once this thing gets under way.
||I mean, you've seen bad acting before, but Good Golly Miss Molly, the folks in this flick weren't even trying.
||The wife Margaret (Diane Adelson) is so inept, you'll cringe in embarrassment.
||But to be fair, there isn't anyone here who's any better, except maybe for Torgo, who I like to refer to as the herky-jerky bearded guy.
||Lordy Mama, what was his deal? You just can't make any heads or tails out of this picture, and as for the couple making out on the side of the road - you might take the same advice they got from the patrolman the first time - "...whatever it is you're not doing, go and do it somewhere else".

||"'Manos' the Hands of Fate" is another grade-Z litany of worthlessness.
||A family is on vacation and drives up to what looks like an abandoned hotel run by semi-hunchback Torgo, who can't stop talking about his "master".
||When we finally meet the master, he turns out to be the Devil's servant, and he's got evil plans for the family.
||How many times have we seen this kind of story?! Fortunately, "MST3K" saved the movie.
||Mike, Servo and Crow really liked the scene where the master's scantily clad wives were having a fistfight (there weren't really any other memorable scenes in the movie).
||On it's own, "MTHOF" is a total zero, but the "MST3K" version is a 10/10.

||A family gets lost on the road and stumbles upon a hidden, underground, devil-worshiping cult led by the fearsome Master (Tom Neyman) and his servant Torgo (John Reynolds).I have a pet peeve with people who watch "Mystery Science Theater" and then come to IMDb and give the film they just watched a 1, causing it to end up on the Bottom 100.
||Roughly half the films on the Bottom 100 are there because of their being showcased on MST3K.
||And while I am not going to say they are not bad movies, they are not among the worst in the world (especially if you keep in mind the bad prints that MST3K often used).That being said, "Manos" is an exception to that complaint -- it truly is among the worst films ever made.
||The plot has no rationale, the scenery is begging for something more...
||the extended drive time in the beginning is unbearable.
||Torgo is awesome, but we really never begin to understand his issues or why he likes to stuff his pants with pillows...I see Shout Factory has a special edition of the film, and I think it would be worth picking up.
||Not because it is a good movie, but because I am just curious how much they could improve on it by touching it up and adding special features.
||As they say, you can polish a horse apple, but it is still a horse apple.

||Man, does this notorious micro-budget atrocity strike out something rotten in every conceivable way: hopelessly all-thumbs (non)direction by Harold P.
||Warren (who also wrote the extremely talky and uneventful script), terrible acting from a lame no-name cast (Tom Neyman as the evil the Master makes for a dreadfully unscary and underwhelming villain while John Reynolds is strictly laughable as his weird limping servant Torgo), crude cinematography, a painfully draggy pace, zero tension or spooky atmosphere, a horribly droning and slushy score, loads of tedious filler, an insufferably whiny little girl, a meandering narrative, and some simply pathetic and unconvincing catfighting amongst the Master's wives.
||Not even the genuinely startling surprise bummer ending manages to redeem the overall mind-numbing boredom of this ghastly clunker.
||Worst of all, this putrid cinematic bilge is way too dull and flat to be enjoyable in its badness; instead it's just an excruciatingly listless'n'lethargic chore to endure.

ISurvivedManos:TheHandsofFate. (1/10)
||Manos: The Hands of Fate, currently ranked #5 on IMDb's Bottom 100, is a rite of passage for serious fans of trashy horror movies, marking the transition from 'merely bad' to 'completely and utterly inept in every way imaginable.
||It's a test of fortitude that sees many fall by the wayside; however, those who do manage to go the distance can wear their achievement as a badge of pride, knowing that they have taken the very worst that z-grade horror can throw at them and survived the ordeal (albeit with possible mental scarring).The one-and-only film from Harold P.
||Warren, who obviously realised thereafter that film directing wasn't his forté, Manos opens with a family driving through the desert on their way to Valley Lodge for a vacation.
||Unfortunately, father Michael (Harold P.
||Warren, proving that acting wasn't his forté either), his wife Margaret (Diane Adelson), and daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) soon find themselves lost, eventually pulling up to a strange desert hostel where they are greeted by twitchy manservant Torgo (John Reynolds), who looks like he stores bags of popcorn or cotton wool down his trousers.Torgo warns that his master (Tom Neyman) won't be happy if they stay the night, but they won't take no for an answer; their stubborn insistence puts them in serious peril, for the master is the head of a Satanic cult and he wants to add Margaret to his collection of brides.To list everything that is wrong with this film would take longer than it took me to watch it (including the times where I fell asleep and had to rewind), suffice to say that there are fewer examples of poor editing, dreary pacing, atrocious direction, woeful acting, and diabolical dubbing.
||Quite how Warren and company managed to mess up in all departments is one of the great mysteries of cinema, ranking right up there with the inexplicable popularity of Seth Rogen, but it has ensured the film a notoriety that means it will never be forgotten.

Ifyoudon'twatchthefilmwiththeMysteryScienceTheater3000commentary,you'llendupmakingyourown... (1/10)
||'Manos' The Hands of Fate attempted something very few filmmakers have ever done before, and un-intentionally no less- this film goes below expectations, but not just any ordinary expectations.
||I knew right from the get go this would be a bad movie from the reputation it's garnered here on IMDb.
||However this takes the cake.
||It ends up being more embarrassing, more horrendous, and more offensive than anything cooked up from the Ed Wood school of low-budget, horror movie-making.
||On top of every performance (even John Reynolds' Torgo, who does pull off that insane servant look, despite no voice to match) stinking to high heaven, every single bit of craftsmanship takes everything that was set up in the cinema world right out the window.The good news for people who wish to see it out of sheer curiosity is that it's now available from the Mystery Science Theater 3000 people (as it has been for ten years, one of it's most infamous specials).
||Their commentary is a plus, and just when you think it can't get any worse, it gets funny by way of them.
||It's hard to heckle a film.
||This is the prime exception.
||All the music, the camera shots (though, giving the benefit of the doubt, it's all shot with one camera getting 30 seconds at a time with no sound attached on location), the atmosphere, the flimsier-than-ripped-flip-flops storyline, it sets a standard that few movies can go to.
||Maybe that's its most impressive feat, that it takes itself so seriously as a legitimate, circa mid 60's B horror film, that it's fun just to watch and experience the depths it goes to.

Ilovethismovieandwilldefendit (5/10)
||How have we taken so long to get this movie on to this website?Since this movie was discovered by Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1993 - which you can hear The Mads discuss on our podcast - this film has been proclaimed the worst movie ever made.Please.
||I've seen way worse films.In fact, Becca and I bonded over the fact that we share a strange adoration for this movie, which seems to exist in its own unique universe that doesn't follow the laws of man.This is a movie that was created as a bet.
||You read that correctly.El Paso, Texas is where Harold Warren, an insurance and fertilizer salesman, and screenwriter Stirling Silliphant - who wrote the movie version of In the Heat of the Night and, of course, Over the Top - made a bet in a coffee shop that Warren could make his own horror movie all by himself.
||To be fair, Warren had done some acting himself and even appeared on Silliphant's TV show Route 66.Not only did Warren make that movie, he had the scent of auteur all over himself, writing, producing and even starring in the resulting movie along with theater actors Tom Neyman and John Reynolds.Nobody in the crew had any experience making a movie.
||They only had $19,000 in their budget.
||And the result was a movie that opened to little fanfare at the Capri Theater in El Paso, where one limo drove each person one at a time, repeating the same loop, and it died except for some drive-ins in West Texas and New Mexico.If Warren had been smart enough to put a copyright on his film, the story would have ended there.
||But he wasn't.
||And he didn't.
||So here we are.As you can hear in the link above, Frank Conniff found Manos while looking through a box of movies for the show Mystery Science Theater 3000.
||The film had been playing on TV for some years - as cheap as $20 for a rental - and was available from public domain suppliers for some time.
||Oh you internet era readers, never having to buy films sight unseen from mail order.Conniff would go on to say that Manos "seemed like it was maybe a crime against humanity, but you couldn't be sure" and "has an atmosphere, a vibe" that made it appropriate for the show."While on vacation near El Paso, Texas, Michael, Margaret, their young daughter Debbie and their dog, Peppy - all dubbed like they're in an Italian movie - are looking for the Valley Lodge.
||They're lost and the film takes forever to find them, spending nearly nine minutes on footage of driving and a teenage couple making out and drinking.The family finally finds a house in the middle of nowhere, which is watched over by Torgo, a satyr that moves at a glacial pace for most of the film.
||He was played by John Reynolds, who sadly committed suicide by shooting himself in the head with a shotgun a month before the film played in his hometown.
||He was on LSD for most of the filming of Manos.For some reason, the family stays the night, despite the Satanic portrait of the master and his dog with glowing eyes.
||They even decide to stay after Peppy the dog is killed by unseen forces and Torgo begins trying to put the make on Margaret.Eventually, we meet the Master and his many brides as they sleep around a gigantic fire.
||They awaken and demand that Michael be sacrificed to their god named Manos.
||At this point, you may look up the fact that manos is Spanish for hands, meaning that the title of this film could be Hands: The Hands of Fate.While all that's happening, The Master decides to sacrifice Torgo and his first wife too.
||There are numerous catfights before the family escapes into the desert night, which makes no sense as this movie is both shot night for day and day for night.When we return to the house, Michael has now taken on Torgo's role and his wife and daughter now belong to The Master.Often, people talk about just how hard it is to make an HP Lovecraft film.
||They've probably never seen this movie, a film that has no horizon lines, that always takes place in a world where it's either too bright to be night or too dark to be daytime, as people say inane things and move strangely and women wear diaphanous gowns and men have smocks with giant red hands on them.This is a movie that promises "A cult of weird, horrible people who gather beautiful women only to deface them with a burning hand!" and then makes the bold statement - nay it's a command - "No one seated the last 10 minutes! We defy you to guess the ending...
||and ask you not to divulge it!"It lives up to every bit of that hyperbole.Despite the film's negative reception, Harold Warren was so proud of it that he began wearing the Master's robe every Halloween.
||His son now carries on the tradition.
||Not bad for a film where the only people who got paid were Debbie (Jackey Neyman Jones) who got a bicycle and the Doberman who got a bag of dog food.
||What about Peppy?

YouMUSTwatchthismovie.ThemasterWOULDapprove. (5/10)
||An acquaintance at IMDb talked about this infamous turkey in a way that interested me: "If you can cast away your ideas of what a movie ought to be, you may be able to enjoy 'Manos: The Hands of Fate'." Truly, this is the kind of thing one treasures if they are into the weird world of ultra low budget schlock.
||And this movie, I could honestly say, is one of those little movies that's off in its own (dream) world.
||It plays out like the events of somebody's insane dream.Basically, a family - mom, dad (played by writer / producer / director Harold P.
||"Hal" Warren), and daughter get lost on their way to a place named Valley Lodge and end up at a back-of-the-beyond abode guarded by an oddball named Torgo, played by John Reynolds in all his twitchy glory.
||Torgo's guarding an entity he dubs The Master (Tom Neyman) who lives with an assortment of "wives".
||Will this family act normally, and get the Hell out of Dodge, or fall into the standard movie trap of being Stupid People Who Do Stupid Things? You'll just have to watch and see.The jazzy music score, by Russ Huddleston and Robert Smith, Jr., is just one of the hard-to-resist elements of this thing, which you'll likely watch while shaking your head, and laughing (sometimes simultaneously), or at least shaking your head.
||Warren stretches out moments to absurd lengths, presumably to get his movies' running time to over an hour long.
||Torgo in particular operates at about half the normal speed of regular people.
||And lines of dialogue tend to get repeated over and over - just to make sure we get the point.
||There's no danger of not knowing any of the character names here!The acting and the pacing is all awkward, yet Warrens' fumbling of his own material gives "Manos: The Hands of Fate" a genuinely dreamy, out there quality that would make this a perfect midnight movie.
||One could easily watch this with friends while drinking and making their own wisecracks as it plays out.
||If they love bad movies, this one has to rank as one of the all time "greats".Five out of 10.

Whatwasthat? (1/10)
||Never has a movie been so dumb, silly, bad, ugly, awful at the same time.
||Is "Manos, the Hands of Fate" really that bad as everyone says it is? Yes, it is and maybe even worse.What makes "Manos, the Hands of Fate" a bad movie is that it was made with no talent or imagination, quite sad to watch really.
||I don't know what is the worst; The acting, the script, the sets, the editing.
||The most likely answer is that it's all just simply plain bad.
||Especially the editing is the worst I have ever seen.
||Some scene's seem to be endless while nothing is shown at it at all and most of the time they don't even have anything to do with the movie.
||The movie is full with this long endless shots that are really about nothing, very boring to say the least.The story is just laughable bad, if you asked me what it is about I think I can not even explain it.
||It's just about nothing and lot's of it makes no sense at all.
||It feels like someone is poking you in the brains with a stick.
||The movie is full with silly moments that makes you think; What the **** is that?The actors are by far some of the worst ever.
||They show absolutely no talent or what so ever.Then we come to the only good thing about the movie: Torgo.
||Oh boy what a character! I doubt it was intentional but this guy is absolutely hilarious with his strange ticks and movements.
||He alone makes this movie still watchable.
||He is a real classic.I also must admit that I liked the ending a lot.

Verynearlycompletelyunwatchable (1/10)
||First off, I applaud the idea behind this.
||The goal of creating a piece that wins over audiences in spite of a low budget is a commendable one, and had this had much merit, or even any, beyond said concept, I would be giving them props.
||Not so.
||It's surely all been said.
||The production value on this is zero...
||where did the money go? Credit for that, along with the summary, goes to my fiancée.
||Having read the Trivia, I still don't understand how this got to be this bad.
||The pacing is nonexistent.
||The plot...
||what there is of one...
||is rehashed and poorly told.
||The twist and the acting(save for obviously the voices, among other things, they don't mix them up enough) aren't(all) necessarily the worst ever, though the way it's captured destroys the very hope of what might have been(the fact that the main guy behind this was a stage person with no directorial training whatsoever explains a lot).
||The attempts to master the cinematic language are marred by dyslexia and a nearly incomprehensible dialect.
||As basic a matter as the focus wasn't always achieved.
||The editing is just...
||while they did only do two takes of everything, and it was all in 32 second segments, that doesn't actually mean he had to do such a lousy job of putting it all together.
||There is a single good cut in the entire thing.
||That's it.
||The effects and believability, save for the aforementioned exception, are simply painful.
||The lighting varies from uninteresting to "not there".
||The dialog, which there is a decided lack of, is uninspired.
||An almost unforgivable amount of this consists of people...
||standing around.
||It's not shot well, either.
||Where is the horror? The atmosphere? The mystery? The scares? *What* is the soundtrack? Who thought to have jazz in this? This builds no suspense and contains no thrills.
||The framing is downright ugly.
||Between the never-ending sequences and scenes, the house of maybe(but certainly no more than) three rooms total, the four characters that could be excised with nothing lost other than running time, this is really barely worth a viewing, and if you must, I suggest the MST3K episode(albeit you can tell they were struggling for material...
||it's limited how many jokes you can do on this without repeating yourself).
||I can't say that I would have survived it if it had been the straight version.
||This is a textbook example of how not to do a movie, if it does tend to make the same mistakes constantly rather than numerous different ones.
||The title has an inherent ironic ring to it, as this was clearly made by a crew with broken hands, and of course, arms.
||I recommend this to anyone into B-flicks, and/or whatever else is this awful.
||The common theater-goer may want to avert their eyes, as this is likely to induce bleeding from them(meanwhile, that would be cooler than anything you'll see in this).
||1/10

"LikesMe?!IThoughtYouSaidHeWasDead!"... (not rated/10)
||Michael (Harold P.
||Warren), his wife Margaret (Diane Mahree), and their daughter Debbie (Jackey Neyman) are on a road trip when they become inexplicably lost.
||Various music samples cut in and out, as the family speaks their overdubbed dialogue.What powers of hell could be causing this?Thankfully, there's a house ahead.
||Is that a tramp? No, it's Torgo (John Reynolds).
||Against his better judgement he takes the family inside, knowing that his Master would not be pleased.
||Here, the nightmare unfolds.The painting! The poodle! The horrible, non sequitur howling sounds!Don't let Debbie sleep on that couch! It's obviously left over from some infernal frat house!Torgo gets weird with Margaret.
||Debbie wanders off.
||The poodle perishes.Meanwhile, The Master (Tom Neyman) is revived!The hair! The robe! The satanic sandals! The bevy of brides in their unflattering nightwear!Now, The Master commands his wives to awaken! Let the bickering and slow-motion brawling begin! Complete with halfhearted slapping!"Man, yes! Child, No!", they chant!More dislocated music plays, and more howling.
||The Master is certainly not pleased!MANOS: THE HANDS OF FATE is the reason cinema was created! Director Warren never made another film, proving his genius! After all, how could he top this miracle? Watching it puts the viewer in a Zen state, much like being stunned by the glancing blow of a passing bus.P.S.- There's a sequel! MANOS RETURNS...

Whywasthismoviemade! (1/10)
||Why did they make this movie? Except for the female wrestling scene I can see no reason at all.
||This is by far the worst movie I have ever seen on MST 3000 and perhaps ever.
||The plot follows a family driving through the country in some backwoods area.
||They are apparently going on a vacation, but who vacations in the middle of nowhere.
||Apparently they are headed to the Valley Lodge which is such a popular place that there is only one sign directing the way.
||Somewhere they get lost along the way and end up at Torgo's place where he is housesitting for the master.
||Nothing in the world indicates that this is a hotel, yet the father insists Torgo a man with an obvious disability carry the luggage back and forth.
||The family's dog gets killed right after they get there and it is to bad, the dog was the best actor in the film.
||Somehow the parents lose their daughter after this as they have their back turned and she exits the room.
||They find the daughter outside and she leads them to the dreaded Master, who is apparently lying on rocks outside with his many wives (what happens when it rains?).
||After a while Torgo is killed by the master for doing naughty things to his immobile wives and the family runs into the desert where the little girl is getting so bored with this movie she stomps on a plant while the mother is crying and doing her scene.
||The father promptly gives away their position by shooting at stock footage of a rattlesnake.
||It ends with two gals heading to the popular Valley lodge and the father is the Master's new housekeeper and the mother and daughter enter the master's Harem (sick, eh?).
||Never watch this movie without MST 3000.

It'sawasteoftimecommentingit (2/10)
||Imagine a cross breed between Dracula and The Stepford Wives done with the budget and inspiration for one episode from a south American soap opera and you get MANOS The...
||hands of fate.
||Luckily for me I've watched in the MST3K version, but this was really bad.
||I mean, bad bad! The previous movie I've commented on I marked as 2 and since I watched it from start to end I can't rate it 1, I need a 1.1 mark here :)The film features the most pathetic devil worshiper ever, the cutest evil hound, the most annoying harem, the jerkiest husband, the most Xanax filled wife (and daughter) in US cinema, the teenage duo with the Guinness record on kissing and a wonderful elevator music soundtrack.It's a must avoid!

Ifyoudon'tlikethisfilm,you'reprobablyjuststupidandignorant. (1/10)
||This is the very best film ever made.
||The direction of Hal Warren is amazing, and ranks at the top with other grand master visualists such as Kurosawa, Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut, Scorsese, Kubrick, Michael Bay and McG.The acting is compelling.
||John Reynolds perfectly embodies the deformed "Torgo." Hal Warren display similarly impressive skills in _front_ of the camera as Michael, the dense man who, after being told "The Master will not be happy" about his family's presence at a creepy old mansion run by a weirdo who can barely walk, tells his wife she is "imagining things" when Torgo tells her that the Master likes her, and is dead, but not dead the way they are familiar with.The screenplay is superb.
||Realistic dialogue flows like cheap champagne at one of Paris Hilton's parties.
||I also particularly loved the Bergman-style shots of nothing-ness -- for example, the opening, which is a ten minute montage of mid-west scenery.
||Kubrick would be jealous.I also loved how all the conversation takes place through facial expressions.
||When Michael and Normal American Family first meet Torgo, no exchange of dialogue takes place for over thirty seconds.
||At first, I thought it was just due to Hal Warren being a totally incompetent director with very poor editing skills.
||But later, I realized it was all in the gestures of Torgo's face, as he stares at them with icy emotion.
||He's translating a message: "I'm here, I'm Torgo, I'm sad and lonely." What a beautiful, poetic and truly moving scene.
||It made me cry, Warren has transcended the genre here - this ranks in the top class of all films of the past century - forget "Citizen Kane," forget "Seven Samurai," forget "Pearl Harbor." This is the best movie ever made, and if you disagree, you're probably just stupid and ignorant.

AwfulYetCompelling (3/10)
||Yes this is an awful film - I mean awful.
||Yet I find something compelling about it - something interesting about it in a weird sort of way.This really is one of the world's worst movies - that I have to agree but it's so horrible that it's entertaining.
||It can be funny, weird and plain boring at the same time.
||This is a film you would have to see to know just how awful it is.
||It's up to you whether or not there is some sort of entertainment value for you - and I don't think it would be for most viewers.
||I am one that has found it entertaining in a weird way.Bad acting, bad lighting, bad cinematography, bad script - yes just terrible.
||Why do I find this one appealing in some strange way? IDK but I do.3/10

Therereallyisn'tanotherfilmlikeManos (4/10)
||For many people Manos: The Hands of Fate is the worst cinematic atrocity to ever have been unleashed upon the world.
||For the average film-goer this is entirely understandable.
||Manos uniquely fails badly in almost all cinematic criteria.
||It's badly paced, terribly photographed, edited abysmally, acted appallingly, it has extremely limited sets, bizarrely inappropriate music and it doesn't make an awful lot of sense.
||It's basically a textbook example of a bad movie.
||And yet, it has a certain something.
||Despite, or perhaps because of, all the faults listed Manos remains a very strange film.
||Its very oddness is what makes it fascinating to watch in my opinion.
||The Master, and especially Torgo, are interesting characters.
||The latter is played by John Reynolds in a very strange performance where he constantly jitters in a most unusual way.
||Torgo is supposedly a satyr, except that you would be forgiven for not realizing this seeing as his goat legs are never actually shown.
||Only in a film as strange as Manos would this happen.
||Also only in a film like Manos would all actors be dubbed by only three people – two men and a woman – and this leads to some very inappropriate voices, such as the one given to the little girl.
||It only adds to the overall whole.Manos isn't even close to the worst film I have ever seen.
||Sit through the likes of The Boys in Blue, Psyched by the 4D Witch or Car 54, Where Are You? and tell me honestly do you think Manos rots the brain like those? It may be technically and artistically awful but it works as a sort of half-remembered fever dream.
||Terrible but quite compellingly so.
||Probably a film that every film fan should see, just so they can make up their own mind.
