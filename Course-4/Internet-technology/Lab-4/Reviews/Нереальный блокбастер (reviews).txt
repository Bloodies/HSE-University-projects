Haven'tweseenthissortoffilm1479timesalready?!And,itwasfunniertheother1478times. (1/10)
||This film begins in 100001 BC and we see a caveman fall into a pile of Wooly Mammoth crap.
||Then, he's attacked by a guy who looks like he's from "American Gladiators" and then an Amy Winehouse look-a-like with fangs.
||Then he awakens and a Flavor Flav lookalike is in bed with him and his girlfriend in the present.
||Shortly after this, a dwarf exits the bed and gives the leading man the finger.
||While parody is supposed to be silly, these images are so random you wonder if the film was written or they just took darts and threw them at story ideas--all very, very fast and all which fell completely flat--and many of which were just very, very crude to hide that it wasn't funny.
||And this, in a nutshell, is what follows for the next 90 or so minutes--one supposed parody after another after another--none of which made me laugh.Here are my suggestions should they want to make another "Disaster Movie" or something like it:1.
||Less jokes and slow down so you have time to work out the parodies.
||Quantity is NOT better than quality.
||Yet, at other times, unfunny skits go on and on and on and on and they had neither quantity nor quality.
||The Hannah Montana and "Enchanted" bits were beaten like dead horses.2.
||Hire professional writers, not squirrels.
||I know they work cheap, but humor is NOT their forte.3.
||Jokes about performing abortions with coat hangers aren't funny.
||The film DID this and I am sure the entire theater when deadly silent.
||Like cancer and 9-11, this is NOT a good topic for comedy.4.
||Jokes involving dwarfs can work, but generally not.
||Unless you can get Mini-Me, don't bother.5.
||Find talented actors and people who really can do parodies.
||It would also help if they vaguely look like the subject of the parody.
||Some did, many did not (like Hannah Montana).6.
||"I just s#%$ myself" is not a particularly funny line.
||Avoid it.7.
||Same goes for "suck on my placenta".
||Not funny.8.
||Keep the "Enchanted" stuff--it's not great but compared to the rest of the film, it's gold.
||Just shorten it A LOT--this skit went on way too long and became 100% stupid.
||In fact, it was only funny for about 30 seconds.9.
||If you're gonna use a lot of actors from "Mad TV", try to get the more talented ones.10.
||No poop jokes.
||Poop is not comedy gold.
||Poop is just poop.11.
||No "Kunk Fu Panda".
||No.12.
||Get rid of Alvin and the Chipmunks unless you are willing to spend more than $13 for the puppets.13.
||Keep Beowulf--one of the only funny characters in the film who stayed funny throughout.
||He came late in the movie, though, and by then I am sure most of the patrons left the theater or killed themselves and never saw him.14.
||And, speaking of kill--kill the director, producers, writers and all the actors.
||I'm not sure if this is legal, but I assume most judges and juries would allow this if they saw the film.

I'dthoughtI'dneverseethedaywhenI'dseesomethingworsethanHomeAlone4,butwiththismonstrosity,itjustgoestoshowhowmuchIcouldbeprovedwrong. (1/10)
||Disaster Movie gets my vote as the "new" worst movie ever made, and there have been abominations like Home Alone 4, Cat in the Hat and NeverEnding Story 3, but none of them are as terrible as this, and that is saying something.
||I thought Disaster Movie crude, lazy and looming towards offensive, (what they said about Amy Winehouse was bang out of order) and some of the repeated gags wore well thin before the first attempt was finished.
||The script was laughable, the writers display no comedic talent and there is a complete lack of laughs, and I am sorry I found the characters very annoying, Giselle especially.
||The acting was terrible, in all my life, I have never seen such terrible acting, and believe me, I have seen a lot of films with terrible acting.
||Matt Lanter and Vanessa Minillo were not only given next to nothing to work with, likewise with Tony Cox, but their performances went nowhere.
||Everyone else was bad too, especially Carmen Electra, whose career I am surprised isn't over yet, in every film she's in, she shows a complete lack of acting ability.
||The film looked as though it had been shot on a cheap studio set, and even the soundtrack was awful.
||Plus the title was completely irrelevant, very rarely did it spoof a disaster movie, all it did was try and be funny and failed miserably.
||Not even the characters spoofed here like Batman, the Chipmumks(a gross ditortion in character and more disturbing than cute and funny) and Hellboy could save this contemptible piece of excrement(I am trying to refrain from swearing, honestly I was seriously considering turning the DVD player off 20 minutes into the movie).
||My dad and brother told me it was very stupid, but unlike them, I am 17 by the way, I didn't find it entertaining in the least bit.
||If you want a good spoof try the silly but otherwise hilarious Loaded Weapon 1! Avoid this thing at all costs! I rest my case, 0/10.

ThePerfectTitle (1/10)
||In general, parody movies are entertaining and recommended when the viewer is upset, expecting to shutdown the brain and laugh with silly jokes.
||That was my expectation with when I selected "Disaster Movie" on DVD this Friday.
||Unfortunately this flick is AWFUL and I was incapable of laughing during the long 88 minutes running time.
||With the due respect the retards deserve, the "directors" and "writers" of this crap certainly have mental or education issues (or both), and I can not imagine how someone sane can produce and put money in this terrible production.
||The only thing that works perfectly is the original title of this disastrous flick.
||My vote is one (awful).Title (Brazil): "Super-Heróis, A Liga da Injustiça" ("Superheroes, The League of the Injustice")

DisasterMovie (1/10)
||Disaster Movie should have been spoofing things like Independence Day, The Poseidon Adventure and Armageddon, not randomly unrelated spoofing all recent pop culture, and the irony is the title is correct, it is a disaster.
||There is no real disaster movie theme to it, it just sees Will (Matt Lanter) at a late 16th birthday, then some meteors hitting a few times, and he, Calvin (Gary 'G Thang' Johnson), Lisa (Razzie nominated Kimberly Kardashian, Juney - spoof of Juno (Crista Flanagan) and Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker) go to save his girlfriend Amy (Vanessa Minnillo), and return the Crystal Skull - like Indiana Jones, and stop all the destruction.
||That's it! Featuring pathetic spoofs of recent (and some old) films, adverts, YouTube video and celebrities, including Twister (throwing cows), Dr.
||Phil (John Di Domenico), The Day After Tomorrow (street freezing), My Super Sweet 16, Justin Timberlake (Jonas Neal), Hannah Montana (also Flanagan), Amy Winehouse (also Parker), High School Musical, Night at the Museum, No Country for Old Men, Superbad, Juno, Enchanted, American Gladiators, Cloverfield (meant to be the main parody), Jumper, Jessica Simpson (Parker again), Step Up 2: The Streets, 10,000 B.C., the "I'm F***ing Matt Damon" video, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Sex and the City (The Movie), You Don't Mess with the Zohan, Wanted, Hancock, Alvin and the Chipmunks, Iron Man, Hellboy, The Incredible Hulk, Michael Jackson (Christopher Johnson), The Dark Knight, Speed Racer, Kung Fu Panda, Beowulf, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull and The Love Guru.
||Also starring Ike Barinholtz as Javier Bardem/Gladiator Wolf/Hellboy/Batman/ Beowulf and Prince Caspian, Razzie nominated Carmen Electra as Beautiful Assassin, Tony Cox as Indiana Jones, American Pie Presents Band Camp's Tad Hilgenbrink as Prince, Di Domenico as Love Guru, Jason Boegh as Male Carrie, Valerie Wildman as Samantha, Abe Spigner as Flava-Flav, Noah Harpster as Jonah, Austin Michael Scott as McLover, Devin Crittenden as Michael Cera, Walter Harris as Hancock, Gerard Facchini as Iron Man, Jacob Tolano Wood as Bruce Banner, Roland Kickinger as Hulk and Yoshio Iizuka as Kung Fu Panda.
||A sabre-toothed Amy Winehouse might have made me giggle burping a lot in the lead guy's face, but the rest of the film just drags along, and to be honest, I was just pleading it would be over soon.
||It looks cheap (apart from maybe some tiny special effects and doubles doing street dancing), and just like Meet the Spartans (also from the guys who made Scary Movie), it just can't be found funny in any way, even if they try.
||It was nominated the Razzies for Worst Picture, Worst Director for Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer; Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-Off or Sequel and Worst Screenplay.
||Very poor!

Acompletedisaster (not rated/10)
||This is a spoof of the latest blockbuster movies amidst a background of disaster.I thought it would be a comical spoof of disaster movies, but instead it does not even spoof.
||It references many unrelated blockbusters that each movie appear for only a few seconds.
||Hence it lacks a coherent theme to stick the spoofs together.In addition, the jokes are very unfunny.
||They are so overdone, over the top and annoying.
||For example, the scene where a princess murders someone is so overdone.
||It might be remotely funny if she shoots once or twice, but not when she shoots for fifteen seconds.Spoof movies can be funny and entertaining, but "Disaster Movie" is a complete disaster that bores me to hell.
||I kept wishing it to end, and when it did, I was so glad it ended.

||Disaster movie...The temptation is to say yes it is.A bunch of 20 somethings sense its the end of the world in the latest disposable spoof film (Will these films have any sort of shelf life?) The plot has a twenty something waking up ans sensing its the last day of the world.
||Spoof of 10,000 BC, Amy Winehouse, Hulk, Ironman, Juno, Indiana Jones, etc etc follow.
||Not as horrible as many of these film, its mostly devoid of badness, or goodness or anything.
||Its bad because there is no reason to watch...well the four or five laughs, but the other 79 minutes of this 80 minute film is like staring at the wall.Wait for cable if you must see this.

"DisasterMovie"IsADisaster! (1/10)
||"Disaster Movie" lives up to its title.
||The latest lowbrow movie lampoon from the writing and directing duo of Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer qualifies as their least imaginative burlesque of blockbuster movies.
||Friedberg and Seltzer contributed jokes for the last two "Scary Movies." Afterward, they ventured out on their own and their first and third spoofs "Date Movie" (2006) and "Meet the Spartans" (2008) fared better than their lamentable sophomore effort "Epic Movie"(2007).
||The theatrical movie poster shows a tidal wave swamping the Statue of Liberty.
||Nothing as large-scale as a tidal wave engulfs "Disaster Movie." When the earthquake strikes, Friedberg and Seltzer do little more than wobble their cameras to simulate cataclysmic events.The best Friedberg & Seltzer parodies single out a specific movie and flesh out the fun with gags from other movies that have nothing to do with the narrative.
||"Date Movie," for example, ribbed the romantic Will Smith comedy "Hitch," while "Meet the Spartans" skewered the homoerotic spear & sandal saga "300." Ostensibly, "Disaster Movie" appropriates the "Cloverfield" plot, but omits everything else plot that distinguished "Cloverfield." "Disaster Movie" doesn't consist of first-person video footage recovered from a camcorder.
||Friedberg & Seltzer have no Godzilla-type monster trampling the city.
||The humor consists of diametrically opposite characters colliding with each other as mobs of panic-stricken people swarm the streets amid chaos.
||Sexual and scatological jokes brimming with PG-13 profanity and partial male nudity seem rather tame because after four movies bowel noises lack hilarity."Disaster Movie" opens with a dream.
||The protagonist, Will (Matt Lanter of "Heroes"), dreams that the year is 10,001 B.C.
||This is a clear reference to the prehistoric potboiler "10,000 B.C." Will imagines that he is a caveman with dreadlocks and a rampaging dinosaur is chasing him.
||Our hero dodges a gigantic dinosaur foot as it pulverizes the ground nearby.
||Instead, he plunges headlong into a pile of dino poop.
||Afterward, he encounters a saber-toothed, alcoholic Amy Winehouse (Nicole Porter of "Mad TV") with her bizarre beehive hairdo.
||Winehouse conjures up a Mac laptop from her beehive.
||She forecasts the end of the world on August 29, 2008.
||An alarmed Matt awakens from his nightmare.
||He discovers two more guys--a tattooed midget and Public Enemy rapper Flavor Flav (Abe Spigner) in the raw--in his bed between him and his cute girlfriend Amy.
||Amy (Vanessa Minnillo of "The Fantastic Four: The Rise of the Silver Surfer") walks out on Will with the midget because he refuses to commit to her.
||Actually, Will's obsession with the end of the world prevents him from committing to Amy.Later, at the sweet sixteen party he never had, twenty-five year old Will and his friends are shaken by earthquake tremors originating near the loft where they are partying.
||Amy leaves the party to check on the National Museum where she works.
||Will and his "Fat Albert" best friend Calvin (newcomer Gary 'G-Thang' Johnson) rush into the streets to witness widespread panic.
||A pregnant teenager, Juney (Crista Flanagan of "Mad Men"), the spitting image of Ellen Page in "Juno," a movie about a wisecracking, knocked-up teenager, joins them.
||Flanagan gets some of the best lines in "Disaster Movie." The closest thing to a catastrophe in "Disaster Movie" are the smoking vapor trails that huge green meteors make as they streak across the sky.
||One meteor pins Hannah Montana (Crista Flanagan again) to the ground, but she continues to sing and advertise her wares.Meanwhile, an "Enchanted" princess (Nicole Parker) emerges from a street man-hole and accompanies our heroes across town to the Natural Museum where an Egyptian statue has Amy pinned to the floor.
||Like the "Clovenfield" heroes, our heroes find shelter in an abandoned building.
||First, they encounter a look-alike "Sex and the City" quartet.
||Juney and a transvestite version of Sarah Jessica Parker as Carrie (Jason Boegh of "First Kiss") tangle like vicious cats.
||Juney kicks Carrie not only with her own feet but also with the feet of her unborn baby.
||Second, our heroes encounter pugnacious animatronic, sweatshirt-clad chipmunks like those from "Alvin and the Chipmunks.
||Predictably, one chipmunk turns rabid and takes a chunk out of Will's crotch.
||Eventually, Will, Calvin, the Princess, and Juney reach the museum and release Amy.
||Amy produces the crystal skull from "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." In the second best joke, we see Indiana's fedora on the floor and the shadow of the famous adventurer scooping it up.
||This time little man Tony Cox, the midget who played singles' counselor Hitch in "Date Movie," fills in for Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones.Unfortunately, Friedberg & Seltzer's fourth movie amounts to little more than amateur high school skits.
||They love humiliating celebrities.
||The impersonations of Amy Winehouse, Dr.
||Phil, Justin Timberlake, Hannah Montana, and Michael Jackson are appallingly inept.
||You may grin at the bawdy song lyrics, but there is nothing worth laughing-out-loud at in this potboiler.
||"Disaster Movie" pokes fun at "Cloverfield," "High School Musical," "Superbad," "Juno," "Iron Man," "Enchanted," "The Dark Knight," "The Love Guru," "Night at the Museum," "Twister," "Wanted," "Kung Fu Panda," "No Country for Old Men," "Beowulf," "Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull," "Speed Racer," and "Sex and the City." Good spoof movies imitate what they mock, but "Disaster Movie" does a execrable job of merely imitating.
||Crista Flanagan's letter perfect imitation of Ellen Page is the sole exception.
||Indeed, "Disaster Movie" contains more perspiration than inspiration.
||Sexy Carmen Electra, who has been in every Friedberg & Seltzer movie, plays the Angelina Jolie character from "Wanted," but her role is more of a cameo.
||Incredibly, the filmmakers haven't included any Brittany Spears scenes but Michael Jackson takes a beating twice.
||He is hiding in the trunk of Speed Racer's jalopy between the monkey and Speed's young brother.
||Altogether, "Disaster Movie" is a disastrous line-up of lame skits thrown together without a clue.

Dire.Seriously. (4/10)
||I am an eternal optimist.
||Every time one of these spoof movies comes on TV, I watch it in the hope that it will be funny.I don't know if people who make these movies read what people say on the IMDb but, on the offchance that they might, here is a tip for them: if you are making a comedy movie, make sure it has some jokes in it.
||You know, things that make people laugh.
||Even one would be good.This film references an awful lot of films.
||Practically none of them are disaster movies.
||This film has more or less no budget at all, so the "disasters" in question comprise shaking the camera and flinging a few polystyrene boulders around.
||There is an interminable musical number at the end during which a number of people pretend to be other people they don't look anything like.This is one to avoid.

ATotalDisaster. (1/10)
||Disaster Movie (2008): Dir: Jason Friedberg, Aaron Seltzer / Cast: Matt Lanter, Vanessa Minnillo, Gary "G Thang" Johnson, Nicole Parker, Tony Cox: Quite possibly the worst piece of trash released in Hollywood since Gigli.
||Title fails because it doesn't actually spoof disaster movies.
||It seems to reference Cloverfield but it really plugged so many references to recent films that the whole film feels like a half assed attempt to gain a quick buck.
||Directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer managed to hit lower than Epic Movie.
||They seem to believe that just referencing other films and making fun of them is all is needed but they are way off.
||Whatever happened to writing a screenplay that contains a plot? There are parody films that have done it as Zucker, Abrahams, Zucker proved on more than one occasion.
||But alas, this film seems content on being low level vulgar with the intelligence of a complete jackass.
||The special effects look about as fetching as a nasty bout of diarrhea.
||On top of that are the terrible acting performances led by Matt Lanter, Vanessa Minnillo, Gary "G Thang" Johnson, and Nicole Parker.
||Tony Cox was wonderful in Bad Santa, but now he is the guy they call to fill in roles in this junk that nobody else wanted associated with.
||Since this film doesn't technically spoof disaster films, it renders it a pointless exercise.
||A disaster in itself and should be flushed down a toilet.

||What I do liked were the songs being sang when they were laughing with High School Musical.
||And face it, Carmen Electra and Kim Kardashian are only in it for their body in which they do the best way they can, cleavage!After all, his can only be watched after necking some brewskies or at a party with a lot of friends but to take it seriously therefore it's a disaster.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 1/5 Comedy 1/5

ANutshellReview:DisasterMovie (1/10)
||I guess the title already tells you everything you need to know about the movie.
||It is without a doubt a total disaster.
||I still find it quite amazing that writer directors Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer still managed to get funds to have their films made, after equally disastrous unfunny comedies such as Epic Movie and Meet the Spartans (OK, I shall unabashedly say that I enjoyed Date Movie), because while it's spoof after spoof, it certainly isn't cheap trying to replicate certain stuff, even if done laced with loads of cheese, or swede-d.Should there be a story linking everything little crazy thing together, then it would be Cloverfield, where a group of friends Will (Matt Lanter, whose left year I found strangely out of alignment with his right?), Calvin (G.
||Thang), Juney (Crista Flanagan), Lisa (Kimberly Kardashian) and the Enchanted Princess (Nicole Parker) journey to save Amy (Vanessa Minnillo) before getting themselves out of the city to escape some unknown and best forgotten natural calamity, where the threat of mankind is raining cows.The only merit I would give the filmmakers is how they went ballistic and stretched their imagination to milk every possible opportunity to script in some other movie, be it borrowing characters or premise.
||You'd probably lose count at the something-new-at-every-minute strategy, and frankly speaking, they're at best some skits which for the life of me, are totally unfunny.
||Nada, zilch, nothing to laugh about.
||I guess even kids will find the juvenile humour here a total turn off.Which is not strange, considering that even jokes were borrowed, and relied too heavily on the usual toilet humour, which is already so tired.
||While there are comedies which can be original, the pedigree of Friedberg and Seltzer, coming as scriptwriters for Scary Movie(s), would by now reinforce that they make poor stories and jokes from their lack of innovation.
||Being able to string together countless of movies is one thing, but making a genuine and workable comedy is another.
||Not having an established cast to star in your movie might stem from a modest budget to work with, but I'm likely to think that everyone approached, save for the relative no-names here, would not want to touch this even with a ten foot pole, just in case it really stinks and stain their filmography.I think it's even time for me to put a foot down and say No to Friedberg and Seltzer.
||The powers that be should really dry up the credit line that fuel their productions, and given some belt-tightening in the economy, hopefully this should be soon.

Anhonestcommentfromsomeonewhohasactuallyseenthemovie (1/10)
||Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer, the way everyone talks about these guys are as if they are on America's Most Wanted List, boy there is a lot of hate before the release date of Disaster Movie.
||They have brought us the "stupid" comedies like Date Movie, Epic Movie, and Meet the Spartans, pretty much all those movies have had the same hate, I can understand why.
||Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer are like the kids in high school who just cruised by, just failing every class possible, being happy with the C's and D's, then they somehow get into Princeton because their parents had money or something, it's the exact same thing with movies.
||The way that I just happen to look at these movies is that they are like a MAD TV spoof, just mindless entertainment.
||I hated Date Movie, didn't mind Epic Movie, liked Meet the Spartans, Disaster Movie is a notch lower than Meet the Spartans.
||We have recycled jokes from the guy's previous movies, jokes that drag on and on to the point where you'll tear your hair out, and is of course, made badly.Will has had a dream that he feels like the end of the world is coming.
||All of a sudden the city is attacked Cloverfield style, he and his friends run around trying to find shelter and figure out what is going on while bumping into one celebrity after another.
||But even Batman, Iron Man, The Hulk, and Hancock can not save this world.
||Will and his friends realize that they have to save the world on their own and fight evil chipmunks, aliens, and flying cows.Disaster Movie, actually does have a couple laughs, I will admit that, I nearly died laughing during the Alvin and the Chipmunks parody, it was so badly funny, I just couldn't help but laugh.
||There are just some fun moments, I think it's ridicules that some people can not admit that.
||That's the reason for my title is because I saw a lot of comments from users that didn't even involve them seeing the movie, they were just complaining...
||this isn't the IMDb that I know, it's silly that people are just putting on comments that have nothing to do with their opinion on why they hate the movie before they even see it.
||Back onto the movie, my main thing that I'm upset with, this movie didn't need a script, it seems as if Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer just made it up as they went along.
||For some reason we have movies that were literally just released last month like Wanted and Hancock, not to mention The Dark Knight.
||I think they just coursed their way through this, while the movie has some funny moments, my HONEST opinion, if you want to see this I suggest the rental, this is straight to DVD quality.1/10

Arealdisasterofafilmbutbetterthananaturalone (4/10)
||STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer hardly have a Jerry Zucker or Pat Proft talent for spoofery, but someone keeps giving them money to churn out these desperate and unfunny send ups of films.
||Here, they aim at modern 'disaster' movies such as Cloverfield, and other none disaster related films like Juno, The Chronicles of Narnia, No Country for Old Men and superhero films (which was already done earlier in the year!) like Iron Man, Hellboy 2 and The Dark Knight.
||While it doesn't do a particularly better job of it than that film, at least the send ups here of these films are a bit more recent and relevant and not just on Spiderman all the time.
||Some care seems to have gone into the Hellboy and IM costumes, so it's weird how sloppy and awful the Batman costume is.
||Likewise, a lot of the actors playing the roles look nothing like who they're supposed to be playing, so it's hard to crack a smile at their material.
||The makers, in all fairness, have been very thorough and have been sure to send everything they can think up, so it's even more of a big blow that hardly any of it is funny at all, least of all an unpleasant scene involving chewing glass.
||I was tempted to walk out at least once, but I did chuckle once or twice so maybe you will too.

||This movie was certainly a surprise....only to me.
||I watched every spoof movie that came out since Scary Movie and this one is clever and ranks near the top....with a 5/10.
||The Scary Movie films were much better than this movie while Meet the Spartans is possibly the worst spoof ever made.As with most spoof movies, there is no need to describe the plot.
||The main storyline/spoof is based on Cloverfield.
||Other movies thrown into spoof mode are Indiana Jones, Iron Man, Batman, Juno, Alvin and the Chipmunks, and Hannah Montana.
||Almost none of these films are disaster movies, just to let you know.There are some strong points and weak, disastrous points.
||The 10,000 BC and Amy Winehouse jokes sucked.
||The Alvin and the Chipmunks and Indiana Jones scenes are funny.
||I also agree with most people that the Hannah Montana scenes were annoying.There are some great actors in here.
||I liked Matt Lanter and the queen of spoof movies, Carmen Electra.There was a good effort by the makers of this film.
||There is not enough to warrant many laughs.
||I can see why over 80% of the comment writers voted a 1 for this film.

notfunnyintheleastbit (1/10)
||this movie is a complete joke, OMFG what a waste of my time, im glad i didn't pay to see this crap, i watched it on the web, but damn this was just terrible.
||Most of the jokes weren't funny and there was so much stupidity.
||This is by far the worst parody I've seen.The things they included are completely stupid, many of the movies they spoofed aren't disasters (EX: incredible hulk, Indiana jones, iron man, superbad, etc).
||The humor was awful and didn't work well.
||It had too much crude and sexual humor, not cool and funny .The beginning was wack and the ending was even worse, it seemed like they just had nothing left at the end so they just added some random crap...the acting was bad and the plot sucked big time If you value your money and time, you wouldn't watch this garbage.Now i see why this movie in #1 on the bottom 100 list.

||Disaster Movie is a 2008 spoof comedy that spoofs the likes of No Country For Old Men,The Hottie And The Nottie,Enchanted (yes one of my favourite movies gets spoofed in this film),Juno,Night At The Museum,Hannah Montana,1000BC,Indiana Jones, Juno and many more.
||For a whooping 88 minutes this film is literally a spoof of a spoof of itself.Movie stars Carmen Electra and yes folks Kim Kardashian(who plays Lisa in this film,hey that's my name and I feel embarrassed now).Do yourselves a favour avoid this piece of trash and if you see it in the bargain bin avoid.Wish I could give it a 0/10.
||Any wonder Kim ditched the acting after this.

Manylong,andshort,badgags! (not rated/10)
||What can we use to describe (Jason Friedberg) and (Aaron Seltzer) with? Hmmm, silly? Yes.
||Lucky? Oh yes.
||But most of all: got nothing to do with movies!According to them, writing and directing are very easy job to do.
||I think these guys just hang out together, drink together, make up jokes about recent movies, TV shows, ads, and celebrities THEN turn them, as they are, into what we so leniently call: movies!Their work, at best, is just gag after gag after gag.
||That could have been good.
||But the result is always dreadful.
||Why is that?There is no plot.
||So why should I care? This time, why they didn't make the whole thing as a journey into fantasy world, a hallucination (it's in a way!), or anything that may win the audience's concern or respect.
||This guys-are-meeting-jokes condition mirrors a sense of belittlement and negligence.
||Ask yourself why (Kimberly Kardashian) had to die? Well, I know.
||They hired her for limited number of scenes, and she must have had other things to do.
||But assuming that that was for a surprise, or even a laugh? FORGET IT, PAL! Hence, I won't bring up axioms like "the character must end up as else what it began with"..
||as here this is off the menu (and I mean the character, along with what's axiom!).
||While comedy is a kind of drama, the hardest kind, it's apparent that this new dual didn't hear of both; drama and comedy!Aside from the incapacity of building a sketch or even a situation, the sense of humor was mostly shoddy, if not nasty and sickening; (Batman) saying, out of the blue, "Do you want to see me play with myself?", (G.
||Thang) is wiping a feces off his face, the leads are riding the car of (Speed Racer), or fighting (Kung Fu Panda).
||Question: Can any of the above pass as droll??I remember reading once that "Comedy is Timing".
||That can be useful to criticize a big crime here; which's the "elongation".
||Considerable part of the gag is in its being as swift.
||Simply, (Friedberg) and (Seltzer) know nothing about that.
||Look at the wrestling match, the dance duel, or the monotone - supposedly sarcastic - performance of Juno-look alike--to see that clearly and badly! Otherwise, they love to do that to fill in their movie to be A MOVIE.
||Because without these tricks, it would be like 50 minutes thing; which could be more merciful, returning this work to its rightful original: TV sneering or internet's take on.This is real heavy: "Many of the films spoofed here hadn't been released when the script was written" OH MY GOD! How they got the nerve?? And does seeing - literally - (Irion Man) got hit, (The Hulk) naked, (Hellboy) annoyed, (Hancock) beaten, and (Indiana Jones) as a midget count as respectable true "spoofing"??!! Ohhh, these are just 2 seconds jokes that fit a trailer.
||They promise with more, while sorrowfully there is no "more".
||Hence, many of them turned the movie into a long boring trailer.
||That's why the movie can be watched, way better, through its trailer!There are no stars.
||It doesn't affect negatively on the popularity of it only, it does affect negatively on its credibility as well.
||Since sometimes the presence of the stars to spoof themselves assures something truthful in the mix, making the laughs louder and more memorable.The image goofs; which's another sign of laziness, or knowing nothing about the tools of the medium.
||For instance, we didn't watch any blood out of the sward that was IN the girlfriend's shoulder.
||Thus with the low level of everything else, it's stupid!Being comic is a mark of smartness.
||So making a parody needs a smart dealing; like - basically - knowing what's to be spoofed in movies and why.
||As putting an irony to make a laugh (the Chipmunks singing hard rock) or a sharp critique (Juno's language).
||These guys are a bit humorous; they fulfilled my dream of giving (High School Musical) what it deserves.
||Almost what it deserves! But surely they lack the talent of writing real script, producing real comedy, and making a real movie.
||And you know what? They don't, just totally don't, learn from their mistakes!(Disaster Movie) is another mistake.
||It doesn't have Disaster but itself, being far from making a joke about any disaster movie.
||I knew lately that it was in fact a (Superhero Movie).
||But it got a last minute change.
||So it's not enough that the poor viewers had to suffer a weak work that disappointed them as a movie and a parody, but they had to suffer more from the bluff of it, and its propaganda, as a thing about certain something, while it isn't.Still the deepest pain this movie causes is basically its character as a "movie" while it's many bad gags, related only by the beer that their makers drank one unfortunate night! Though, what I can't figure out to date is how they got Hollywood high executives involved in their uncreative drinking and joking?!!Since it's not a parody "movie", is it merely a parody? I believe the rule is being whether an original thing, or an original parody of it.
||And this movie is the original *bad* both! The good thing about it is providing a fine example to study one of the wrong ways of making a movie or parody.
||It's supposed to puck fun out of the worst points in other movies, but ended up as a series of the worst points collected in one!Finally, with Date, Epic, Meet, then Disaster, "The Hollywood Parody Movie"..
||R.I.P.

AverageDisaster (6/10)
||Many critics thought that the latest spoof flick "Disaster Movie" was a total disaster.
||I am not too far off from that school of critical thought, but we all shall not assess into the disaster too seriously.
||Take it for what it is- a spoof film that does not prioritize on plot premise but on spoof comedy delivery.
||We gotta plethora of films and characters being parodied here: Amy Winehouse, Juno, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Enchanted, High School Musical, Sex and The City and an avalanche of others.
||My personal favorite was the Juno one! It impregnated me to tears from laughing! Other mimics were minimally funny while others did get my chuckles to materialize.
||"Disaster Movie" will not be a total cinematic natural disaster but it will not be your fall comedic savior either.

WatchDateMovieinstead. (4/10)
||I want to see a really good parody movie.
||One that's dumb and crass and non-intellectual.But although this movie is all those things it's not good.
||It spends way too much time on one joke and many scenes feel like they take forever.
||I feel I could have written some scenes better or come up with better gags after seeing the scenario.I can imagine a lot of movies I like less but it's not worth the time.
||Maybe watch it for a quick distraction in the hotel room but it really doesn't deserve the attention.Edit: I am a bit surprised it is the lowest rated movie on this whole site.
||Sure it kind of sucks but I would never say it was ever a candidate for worst movie ever.
||I would say there are many movies much worse than this.
||I would take this over the following:Mother!This is Spinal TapSchindler's ListThe ConjuringApartment 1303Bridesmaids

MishmashofUnfunnyMovieReferences (2/10)
||I had no intention of ever watching this movie.
||But I had time to kill before a meeting and this was being shown for a mere P15 at the mall, and was short enough for the time I had."Disaster Movie" was an aimless mishmash of stupid references to various recent movies.
||They did not only reference disaster movies.
||Of disaster movie references, I only recognized "Cloverfield", "Twister" and maybe "The Happening." The references for the major gags included "Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull", "Juno", "High School Musical", "No Country for Old Men", "Enchanted", "Beowulf" and even "Alvin and the Chipmunks", which are certainly NOT disaster movies.
||It also had lame scenes with Batman, Iron Man, the Hulk, Prince Caspian, Kung Fu Panda, etc.
||It even has unflattering references to specific celebrities like Amy Winehouse, Miley Cyrus, Jessica Simpson, Sarah Jessica Parker and an unfortunate scene with Michael Jackson.
||In short, it is disastrous mixed-bag gag show with a lot of flat, dirty or disgusting jokes.
||I haven't seen the previous Friedberg/Seltzer incarnations like "Date Movie" or "Epic Movie", and have no more plans to.
||The actors are just plain annoying and unfunny most of the time.
||It was only at the end that I realized that the lead actress was actually Fil-Am celebrity Vanessa Minnillo in her first major movie role.
||Yikes!
